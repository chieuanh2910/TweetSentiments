# Tweet Sentiments
This analysis delves into the sentiment of airline tweets using a Python-based approach. The dataset was meticulously explored, revealing valuable insights into the opinions and feelings of customers towards different airlines.

Among the significant findings, it was observed that United Airlines emerged as the most talked-about airline, generating 3822 tweets, closely followed by US Airways and American Airlines. In terms of geographic distribution, the top five states with the highest customer engagement were identified as New York, California, Texas, Massachusetts, and North Carolina.

The analysis employed two predictive models, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest, to forecast tweet sentiment. These models allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the general sentiment trend across the different airlines.

Upon further examination, it was observed that United Airlines stood out with the highest proportion of positive tweets, while US Airways faced a higher proportion of negative sentiment.

To extract deeper insights, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique was applied for topic modeling. The technique unveiled ten distinct topics, with the most prevalent negative issues revolving around prolonged waiting times, customer service concerns, booking system difficulties, and subpar phone call experiences.

In summary, this analysis has successfully utilized Python to explore and interpret the sentiment of airline tweets. By identifying trends, opinions, and critical topics, the study provides a comprehensive overview of customer perceptions and experiences, allowing airlines to make informed decisions and improvements.
